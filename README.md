This package provides tooling support for theme generation in Dojo 2.

## Features

Adds a `dojo create theme` command which displays an interactive instruction to ask two questions:

* What Package to do you want to theme?
* Which of the theme files would you like to scaffold?

Upon successful execution of this command, `dojo create theme` creates a number of files for you in your app:

* `src/themes/theme.ts`
* `src/themes/widget/path/widget.m.css`

The latter CSS module comes ready with themable CSS selectors which you can fill in the styles for.

## How do I use this package?

Install `dojo/cli-create-theme` in a Dojo 2 app:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @dojo/cli-create-theme
```

Run the command: `dojo create theme`.

For example, if you have widgets which live in the folder: `node_modules/@dojo/widgets`, you can enter: `@dojo/widgets` as the answer to `What Package to do you want to theme?`.
