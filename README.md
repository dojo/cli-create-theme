This package provides tooling support for theme generation in Dojo 2.

Imagine a scenario in which you are using third-party widgets in your Dojo 2 application (or the widgets provided by `@dojo/widgets`) and you want to theme them to match your existing application styles. This is where the `dojo create theme` command helps you.

This package will quickly generate theme scaffolding for third party widgets.

## Features

Adds a `dojo create theme` command which displays an interactive instruction to ask two questions:

* What Package to do you want to theme?
* Which of the theme files would you like to scaffold?

Upon successful execution of this command, `dojo create theme` creates a number of files for you in your app:

* `src/themes/theme.ts`
* `src/themes/widget/path/widget.m.css`

The latter CSS module comes ready with themable CSS selectors which you can fill in the styles for.

## How do I use this package?

Install `dojo/cli-create-theme` in a Dojo 2 app:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @dojo/cli-create-theme
```

Run the command: `dojo create theme`.

For example, if you have widgets which live in the folder: `node_modules/@dojo/widgets`, you can enter: `@dojo/widgets` as the answer to `What Package to do you want to theme?`.

### Compatible packages

Any package that has a `theme` directory containing `.m.css` and coresponding, compiled definition files (`.m.css.js`) is compatible.

```
node_modules
└── package
    └── theme
        │   theme-file.m.css
        │   theme-file.m.css.js
```

```bash
npm run prettier
```
